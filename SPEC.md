# Travel Expense Tracker — Specification

A personal, offline-first tool to capture individual expenses during a trip,
grouped into fixed categories, with running totals and a spreadsheet export.
Modeled closely on the sibling project `dts-expense-tracker`, minus everything
specific to DTS reconciliation (no GTCC/personal split, no M&IE, no mileage
calculator, no "entered in DTS" tracking, no DTS-expected-totals input).

## Context & constraints

- **Capture device:** phone, as an installable PWA, usable offline (no signal
  during travel).
- **No backend.** Data lives on the device (IndexedDB via localForage). Nothing
  leaves the device except the CSV/spreadsheet the user chooses to export. No
  accounts, no sync.
- **Single user, single household.** No auth, no multi-user concerns.

## Currency model (no conversion)

Each expense carries **two amount fields, both optional**, same convention as
`dts-expense-tracker`:

- `amount_gbp` — entered at time of purchase; matches the receipt.
- `amount_usd` — backfilled later once the charge registers on the credit
  card.

No automatic conversion between the two. An expense with a GBP amount but no
USD amount yet is **"USD pending."** Totals **never mix currencies** — GBP and
USD are always shown as separate columns — but **USD is the total that
matters**: it's the number that reflects what actually got charged, and it's
what any future budget-vs-actual comparison will be measured against.

An expense needs at least one of GBP/USD to save (same rule as the reference
app).

## Categories (fixed set, fixed order)

1. Transport
2. Accommodation
3. Food & Dining
4. Pet Sitting
5. Entertainment
6. Misc

## Data model

### Trip

Every expense belongs to a trip. A device always has at least one trip (a
default is auto-created on first load, or migrated from pre-Phase-3 data —
see Phase 3 below); the header's trip switcher lets the user create,
rename, switch between, and delete trips.

| field        | notes                                                              |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`         | generated once, when the trip is created                            |
| `name`       | user-editable, shown in the header trip switcher                    |
| `createdAt`  | ISO timestamp                                                        |
| `budget_usd` | optional, per-category USD ceiling (Phase 2); absent = not set yet    |

`budget_usd` is a map keyed by category (a subset of the 6 fixed categories
may be set; the rest are treated as no budget / $0 ceiling). It lives on
`Trip` rather than a separate record, so switching the active trip carries
its budget along automatically.

### Expense

| field        | notes                                                              |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`         | generated                                                            |
| `tripId`     | the trip it belongs to; scopes it to that trip's data/exports         |
| `date`       | defaults to today on entry; freely editable                         |
| `category`   | one of the 6 fixed categories above                                  |
| `amount_gbp` | optional                                                             |
| `amount_usd` | optional; backfilled when the charge lands on the card                |
| `note`       | optional (vendor / description)                                     |
| `status`     | optional, `'planned' \| 'actual'` (Phase 2); absent = `'actual'`       |

`status` distinguishes a known-but-unpaid commitment (`'planned'` — e.g. a
hotel reservation with an estimated amount) from a normal, already-incurred
expense (`'actual'`, the default). There is no separate "reservation" entity:
a planned expense is just an `Expense` row with `status: 'planned'`, and
**reconciling** it means editing that same row — filling in the real
amount(s) once known and flipping `status` to `'actual'` — rather than
creating a new row. Absent/undefined `status` is treated as `'actual'` so
pre-Phase-2 stored expenses need no migration.

No `payment` field (no GTCC-vs-personal concept), no `entered` field (no DTS
to key into), no `miles`/`rate` (no mileage calculator).

## Totals view

One table, by category, in the fixed category order:

- GBP total and USD total per category (never summed together).
- A grand total row (GBP and USD).
- A count of USD-pending expenses per category, surfaced as a flag (e.g. "2
  missing USD") — informational only, since there's no DTS total to compare
  against and therefore no mismatch/match logic like the reference app's
  reconciliation view.

**Actual spend only** (Phase 2): totals here only include expenses with
`status: 'actual'` (or no `status` at all). A planned/reserved expense (e.g.
an unpaid hotel reservation) does not count toward these numbers or the grand
total until it's reconciled to `'actual'` — this view answers "what have I
actually spent," not "what have I committed to." Planned expenses are visible
in the List view (with their own filter/badge) and in the Budget view below.

## Screens (MVP)

1. **Entry** — form with a category dropdown, GBP and USD fields side by side,
   editable date defaulting to today, optional note. Optimized for fast
   repeated entry: after save, amounts and note clear but date/category
   persist for the next row (same UX as the reference app). Phase 2 adds a
   "reserved / not yet paid" checkbox that sets `status: 'planned'`.
2. **List** — all expenses for the trip, newest first; editable/deletable
   inline; a "USD pending only" filter. Phase 2 adds a "planned only" filter
   and a "Planned" badge alongside the existing USD-pending badge.
3. **Totals** — by-category table described above (actual spend only as of
   Phase 2).
4. **Export** — one tap → CSV and/or formatted `.xlsx` (see below).
5. **Budget** (Phase 2) — by-category table: BUDGET (editable USD ceiling per
   category), ACTUAL (sum of `'actual'` expenses' `amount_usd`), PLANNED (sum
   of `'planned'` expenses' `amount_usd`), REMAINING (`BUDGET − ACTUAL −
   PLANNED`), plus a grand-total row. GBP-only expenses (planned or actual)
   contribute $0 to ACTUAL/PLANNED until a USD amount is filled in — no
   GBP→USD fallback, keeping the "never mix currencies" rule intact here too.
   A category with no budget set shows `$0.00` and goes negative as soon as
   anything is spent/planned against it.

No Help/FAQ tab in the MVP — there's no DTS-specific domain vocabulary to
teach (no "USD pending vs. incomplete vs. mismatch," no M&IE vs. MILEAGE). If
that turns out to be wrong, add one later.

## Export

Two formats, matching the reference app's approach:

- **CSV** (hand-rolled, no dependency): expense rows (Phase 2 adds a `planned`
  column), then a totals-by-category block (GBP, USD, `usd_pending` count —
  actual-only as of Phase 2), then a grand total, then (Phase 2) a
  `BUDGET VS ACTUAL` block — one row per category (`budget_usd`, `actual_usd`,
  `planned_usd`, `remaining_usd`) plus a `TOTAL` row.
- **`.xlsx`** (ExcelJS, dynamically imported to stay out of the main bundle):
  a formatted workbook — a **Totals** sheet (by category, USD-pending rows
  highlighted, actual-only as of Phase 2), a **Budget** sheet (Phase 2 — same
  columns as the CSV block, rows over budget highlighted), followed by an
  **Expenses** sheet (raw rows, Phase 2 adds a `Planned` column/highlight). No
  mismatch highlighting (nothing to mismatch against).

Both share one export model (`report.ts`-equivalent) so CSV and XLSX can't
drift from each other, same pattern as the reference app.

Shared via the Web Share API where available (mobile share sheet), with a
plain download fallback — same as the reference app.

## Tech stack

Same as `dts-expense-tracker`, minus what's not needed:

- **Vite + React + TypeScript** (strict).
- **localForage** over IndexedDB for persistence.
- **CSV export** hand-rolled; **`.xlsx` via ExcelJS**, lazy-loaded.
- **PWA** via `vite-plugin-pwa` (installable, offline-first, update toast).
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions (`base: '/travel-expense-tracker/'`).
- No `reconcile.ts`, no `mie.ts`/`mileage.ts`, no DTS-expected-totals storage.

## Phased plan

**Phase 1 — MVP (this spec)**
1. Expense entry (date, category, GBP, USD, note).
2. List with edit/delete and a USD-pending filter.
3. Totals by category (GBP/USD separate, USD-pending flagged).
4. CSV + `.xlsx` export; local persistence (IndexedDB); installable PWA.
5. Data model carries a hidden `tripId` on every expense so Phase 3 doesn't
   need a migration.

**Phase 2 — budgeting**
6. Pre-trip budget entry, per category (USD, since that's the total that
   matters once cards settle) — a flat ceiling per category, not tied to any
   specific expense (e.g. "$1000 for Food & Dining" with no individual rows
   pre-allocated against it).
7. A `status: 'planned' | 'actual'` field on `Expense` for known-but-unpaid
   commitments (e.g. a reserved hotel): a planned expense is an ordinary
   `Expense` row with an estimated amount, entered ahead of time, that counts
   as "committed" rather than "spent." Reconciling it means editing that same
   row once the real charge lands (fill in the amount, flip `status` to
   `'actual'`) — not creating a second row.
8. A **Budget** view/export section: BUDGET / ACTUAL / PLANNED / REMAINING
   per category, analogous in spirit to the reference app's DTS reconciliation
   but comparing against a budget you set yourself rather than a third-party
   system. The existing Totals view/export narrows to actual-only spend so
   planned commitments don't inflate it before they're real.

**Phase 3 — multi-trip**
9. ~~Trip creation/switching UI (the `tripId` plumbing from Phase 1 makes this
   additive, not a migration).~~ **Done** — a `trips: Trip[]` registry and
   `activeTripId` live in IndexedDB (`db.ts`), migrated from the old
   single-trip flat keys by `ensureInitialized()` (idempotent; an upgrading
   user's existing trip keeps its id/name/`budget_usd`, a fresh install gets
   one default trip — no naming prompt either way). `useTrips.ts` owns the
   registry plus create/rename/delete/select; a device always has **at least
   one trip** (deleting the last one is disallowed). Each trip's expenses
   live under `trip:<id>:expenses`-prefixed keys, loaded by
   `useTripData(tripId)`, which reloads whenever the active trip changes. The
   header's `TripSwitcher` is the switch/create/rename/delete UI, reachable
   from every tab — the existing 5-tab bottom bar is unchanged.
10. ~~Per-trip budgets and exports; a trip list/summary view.~~ **Done** —
    `budget_usd` already lived on `Trip` (Phase 2), so per-trip budgets were
    already additive once (9) landed; `useTrips.setBudget(tripId, category,
    amount)` patches the right trip. Exports (CSV/`.xlsx`) are per-trip by
    construction (they only ever see the active trip's expenses), and
    filenames/the `.xlsx` Totals sheet title fold in the active trip's name
    (slugified for filenames) so multiple trips' exports don't look
    identical. No separate trip list/summary screen — the header switcher's
    open panel already is one.

**Phase 4 — nice-to-haves (not committed)**
11. Backup/restore all data as a file.
12. Receipt photos.
